# Embedded Projects

A collection of hands-on embedded systems projects built while learning
microcontrollers, sensors, and hardware–software interaction.

This repository serves as a long-term workspace for experimenting with
embedded concepts using platforms such as Arduino and, in the future,
Raspberry Pi.

The focus is on understanding fundamentals, building practical hardware
projects, and maintaining clean project structure and version control.
